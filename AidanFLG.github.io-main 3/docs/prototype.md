Our Project is called Project Genisis. Our project is intended to be an app-creating project. It converts Blockly code into swift code that is intended to be downloaded and copied into Xcode to easily develop an app.

This group project is a creative and educational initiative that combines the power of Blockly, a visual programming language, with the world of Swift, Apple's programming language for iOS and macOS app development. This project aims to simplify and demystify the process of creating SwiftUI-based user interfaces in Swift by providing a visual, block-based interface.

The project incorporates a collection of custom Blockly blocks tailored specifically for SwiftUI, allowing users to construct SwiftUI ContentView structures, declare variables, and easily create user interface elements. These Blockly blocks abstract the complexities of Swift code, making it accessible to beginners and students while also serving as a productivity tool for experienced developers.

Key features of the project include the ability to:
- Import necessary Swift frameworks, such as SwiftUI.
- Create ContentView structures effortlessly.
- Declare variables and state variables with various access control options.
- Design SwiftUI user interfaces visually using Blockly's intuitive interface.

Overall, this project empowers users, from novice programmers to seasoned developers, to learn SwiftUI interactively and prototype user interfaces quickly. It serves as an innovative bridge between visual programming and traditional text-based coding, fostering creativity and proficiency in iOS and macOS app development.

To recreate the demonstration given in class, use the following steps:

1.) Click Project Genesis

2.) Click Start Blocky

3.) Click SwiftUi

4.) Drag the Import Swiftui block to the developer

5.) Drag the struct block to the developer, don't connect to the block above

6.) Title the struct ContentView

7.) Drag the variable named block to the developer, and nest it in the struct block

8.) Name the Variable message and set the value field to "HELLO"

9.) Drag the public/private variable block to the developer, and attach it to the bottom of the variable named block

10.) Set it to private, set the variable name to state, and the value field to true
