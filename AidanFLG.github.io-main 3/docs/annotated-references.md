1. [Dr. Kurz's Blockly Lamda Calculus](https://github.com/alexhkurz/BlocklyLambdaCalculus/tree/main) - Provides an example of a blockly demo where a user can take blocks out of the toolbox and piece them together to create basic lambda calculus programs. We used this blocky code to have a base for how our code was created.

2. [Create a Github Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) - We used this to figure out how to run a program from our github to make a webpage to demo our project

3. [Blockly Developer Tools Guide](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/blockly-developer-tools) - We used a basic tutorial on how to interact with the blockly web editor to design blocks and add them to a toolbox before exporting them to your local machine as a way to design our blocks compared to a developers view.

4. We used Xcode/swift to understand what code our blocks need to be creating to use basic lines of swift code.
