## Work Logs

### Aidan and Tony have taken IOS classes so they will focus on the idea creating of how each block will work and Jordan will focus on designing a new interface that will make it easier to build with the blocks, while we all work together on making the code for the Blocks/Interface.

## AI Use

### We first used Chat GPT to help us understand how to build blocks as well as how to add certain attributes to blocks that we could not find information from online.
### We also used AI to help us Debug  our code when we could not determine the issue on our own with block errors and webpage errors.
